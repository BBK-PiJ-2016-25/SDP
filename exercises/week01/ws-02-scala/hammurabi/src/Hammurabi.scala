        |out for rat infestations and the plague! Grain is the general currency,
        |measured in bushels. The following will help you in your decisions:
        |* Each person needs at least 20 bushels of grain per year to survive.
        |* Each person can farm at most 10 acres of land.
        |* It takes 2 bushels of grain to farm an acre of land.
        |* The market price for land fluctuates yearly.
        |Rule wisely and you will be showered with appreciation at the end of
        |your term. Rule poorly and you will be kicked out of office!
